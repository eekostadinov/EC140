    Welcome to Numerical methods for EC140
</span>

<br/>

This is a small e-book of lecture notes on numerical methods with R, designed to be used in conjunction with the lecture materials on the Moodle page of **EC140 Mathemathical Techniques B** at Warwick. 



:::{tip}
In order to work through the code in these notes yourself, you need a working installation of R. 

Once you have R installed, it is also recommended that you install RStudio and execute your codes from your RStudio program. 

Both R and RStudio are free and open-source. 

If you are using a University computer, R and RStudio should already be installed. 

If you work from your personal computer
- you can download the most recent version of R for your operating system from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) and follow the instructions there to install. 
- you can download the most recent version of RStudio Desktop for your operating system from [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) website and follow the instructions there to install.
:::

During each week of term, the Moodle page will contain a link to a specific chapter in this book. The best way to use this book during EC140 is to follow the instructions on the Moodle page and focus only on the chapter specified there as some of the content discussed will not be covered until later in the module. 

Once you have completed EC140 please feel free to return here and access the notes at any point in time.
